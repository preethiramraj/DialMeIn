Column Name	Definition
ID*	Auto generated unique identifier for the incentive
Data Source URL(s)*	All source URL(s) to pages/pdfs/websites from where the data is being pulled from. This can also be referred to as the source url of the data entered in this row/source url that you used to get the information from.
Authority Level*	The level of the authority administering the incentive program to the consumer (usually state, utility, federal, muni)
Authority (Name)*	"Name of the authority that is administering the incentive program 
(eg., State office of energy, utility provider name)"
Program Title*	Title of the incentive program when available. If there is no explicit title, use Authority name + Technology
Program URL	"This will be the link that is shared with the consumers as ""Learn More"" when they see an incentive that interests them. It can be a link to the incentive program page, or a PDF for the rebate form. 

Tip: Try to identify the best resource to send users to when they want to ""Learn More"" about the incentive. When in doubt, capture both."
Program Description	A short description of the incentive program and the rebate value it offers including any limitations at a very high level (refer to the guidelines here)
Program Description (Spanish)	The "Program Description" in Spanish. OK to leave this blank during initial data collection, to be translated separately.
Program Status	Status of the incentive program (active, expired, paused, unknown)
Program Start	The date when the program becomes effective or is available. If the program status is paused, capture the restart date (if available) separately from the program start date (add two entries). It is possible and acceptable for this value to be unknown since many incentive programs may not have this published yet / may not be launched yet.
Program End	The date when the program expires and cannot be redeemed. Usually renewed at an annual basis. It is possible and acceptable for this value to be unknown since many incentive programs may not have this published yet / may not be launched yet.
Technology*	The technology (appliance or product) for which the rebate applies
Rebate Type	"Indicates how the consumer receives the rebate 
(Point of sale rebate, tax credit, account / bill credit, financing)"
Rebate Value*	The rebate value in plain English (could be a combination of all the rebate sub-fields below) 
Rebate Value #1: Amount Type*	Indicates the structure in which the incentive is being offered for the particular technology / product (e.g. dollar_amount, dollar_per_unit, percentage)
Rebate Value #2: Number*	"The incentive amount as it relates to amount type. 
-If type is dollar_amount or dollar_per_unit, this represents the incentive amount in dollars. 
-If the type is percentage, then this should be a number between 0 and 1. "
Rebate Value#3: Unit	The unit of the incentive offering (eg., ton)
Rebate Value#4: Amount Minimum	The minimum value of the incentive being offered for the particular technology / product. 
Rebate Value#5: Amount Maximum	The maximum value of the incentive being offered for the particular technology / product. 
Rebate Value#6: Amount Representative	The estimated average incentive amount as recommended / calculated by the incentive provider. (not mandatory)
Equipment Standard Restrictions	Incentive eligibility criteria on what you buy based on the appliance standard / rating  (SEER, Energy efficent rating). Also capture eligibility for EVs here such as EV MSRP maximum to qualify for an EV rebate
Equipment Capacity Restrictions	Incentive eligibility criteria based what you buy based on the appliance capacity (ton/size limits)
Contractor Restrictions	Incentive eligibility criteria based on who you buy it from for the installation requirements (contractor network, suppliers etc)
Income Restrictions	Income eligible conditions to qualify for the incentive when applicable. This could be a flat maximum number for EV rebates, but also a percentage of Area Median Income (AMI), which is defined by HUD for each (for complex income guidelines listed as table, add a separate tab capturing that income guideline and link the tab out in this cell)
Tax-filing Status Restrictions	"Tax filing status to qualify for an incentive
For example, there is a maximum income for each tax filing status for both the new and used EV credits."
Homeowner/Renter	Indicates ownership of the property - homeowner or renter. Use your judgement to make a call on if the appliance incentive makes sense for a renter - We typically think of this as something you could take with you if you move, vs a "fixture" in the home that only the owner benefits from.
Other Restrictions	All other incentive eligibility criteria (new / qualified products, application timeline etc)
Bonus Details	A bonus or a prerequisite are mostly applicable for for different appliance type, combined with another appliance's rebate offer. (eg., weatherization required to get heat pump, or heat pump required to get electric service upgrade) from the same incentive program.
Stacking Details	Details on what incentives can be (or should be) stacked together to maximize on multiple incentive offerings whenever eligible (includes bonus offers). Example, some programs offer a flat point of sale rebate AND an enhanced additional rebate if you qualify for the income threshold. Alternatively for some federal incentive, you may need to use one incentive to qualify for the other incentive for another item. Capture this as a freetext including the ID of the incentive it can be stacked with. Include any total project cap details as you include stacking information (eg., total installation cost is capped at 75% when multiple rebates are stacked together)
Financing Details	Any financing / loan programs offered for supporting the purchase of the appliance / product
